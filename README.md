# .dotfiles

This repository is filled with my own personal dotfiles. There probably isn't much here for you unless you're wanting to creep around at my configurations. Feel free to take anything you see here and use it for yourself if you'd like.

## Installing

```bash
# What needs to be ran
./link.sh
```
After running that just open a new terminal and it should be good.
